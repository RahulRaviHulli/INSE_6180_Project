####1.1 Mounting Google Drive

These three lines of code are used to mount Google Drive in Google Colab, which allows you to access files and directories stored in your Google Drive from within the Colab environment. Here's a brief explanation of each line:

from google.colab import drive: This line imports the drive module from the google.colab package. This module provides functions to interact with Google Drive.

drive.mount('/content/drive'): This line calls the mount function of the drive module and mounts your Google Drive at the specified directory /content/drive within the Colab environment. After running this line and following the authentication instructions, you'll be able to access your Google Drive files under this directory.

These lines are commonly used at the beginning of Colab notebooks to set up access to Google Drive for loading and saving files.
